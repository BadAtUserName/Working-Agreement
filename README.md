# Working-Agreement
A markdown document to focus on the final project for 201

## The Idea!<br>
### --The Washington department of Fish and Wildlife sport catch online tracking system 

<em><strong>In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?</strong></em><br>
* Improving my logical thinking will be the main goal for professional competencies to improve. 

<em>Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?</em><br>
* The day to day work, I think spacing it out over many days is going to be the best for me. I am going to try to take more breaks and not just run my head into a wall many times. I do see that what I want to make is very similar to projects we have already done so I would be able to piece things together. 

<em><strong>What will be your groupâ€™s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?</strong></em><br>
* As a solo developer on this project I will be reaching out to others for help and taking breaks. A break every 90 minutes from the task I am trying to accomplish.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
This is not an issue I anticipate. However if I was working with a team; opening up communication would be the best way to avoid this. I do think this does happen often in group work, someone takes the lead and others follow. I do think that if it is a problem and one person is doing all the work it is best to point it out. At times people do not realize they are not letting other do work. 

<em><strong>How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?</strong></em><br>
* On my own I know my limitations pretty well. I do think that reaching out to those around me is going to be my biggest challange and an opportunity to practice asking for help when needed.

<em><strong>What hours will you be available to communicate?</strong></em><br>
* I am available for communication that will not be consistent from the hours of 8a-5p and quite consistently from 5p -10p I am available for working on the project from 2-4p and 5p-10p I am unavailable on Thursdays for work, and Friday I am not usually available till later in the evening after 9p. 

<em><strong>How often will you take breaks?</strong></em><br>
* Every 90 minutes, to give my brain a break and give it a chance to work on things in the background. 

<em><strong>What is your plan if you start to fall behind?</strong></em><br>
* Reevaluating the minimum viable product and adjusting expectations.  


<em><strong>What project management tool will be used?</strong></em><br>
* I do not intent to use a project management tool at this time. All aspects of the project will be available to me and will require my attention and time. 

<em><strong>Will you be using a PR review workflow?</strong></em><br>
* As the sole developer on the project I will be managing all the pr reviews.
